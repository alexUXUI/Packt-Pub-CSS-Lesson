Artifacts for a lesson plan on Fluid Layouts and Responsive images

## Fluid Layout and Responsive Images Lesson
I was asked by Packt Publishing to create a teacher-lead lesson plan for one of their more popluar books, which covers responsive and modern HTML5 and CSS3. The following lesson deals specifically with using Flexible Box Layout Module and responsive images to create fluid, scalable, and beautiful layouts on every screen resolution.

This is a very rough draft. It is full of spelling and grammatical errors. As such, PR's are MORE than welcome. 

### Getting started
1) Clone this repo
2) Open the starting point folder and double click on index.html
3) Then open 'fluid layout and responsive images' PDF.
4) Read the lesson and follow along with the instructions
5) The end result should be close to the website in the 'final folder', open this folder to check your work
